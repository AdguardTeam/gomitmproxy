	// OnConnect is called when the proxy tries to open a net.Conn.

	// 1. When the proxy handles the HTTP CONNECT.
	//    IMPORTANT: In this case we don't actually use the remote connections.
	//    It is only used to check if the remote endpoint is available
	// 2. When the proxy bypasses data from the client to the remote endpoint.
	//    For instance, it could happen when there's a WebSocket connection.

	// 2. Supply an HTTP response to be written to the client
	//
	// Return nil instead of *http.Request or *http.Response to keep
